                        I'm a creative game programmer who wants to make immersive games that people love to play. I specialize in traditional 2D and 3D games using C# and Unity, but have also built a virtual reality game in Unreal Engine 4 using visual scripting blueprints.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm organized and love solving problems and puzzles of all sorts. Thanks to my background in customer service, I have strong communication skills and 8 years of experience working as part of a team in challenging environments.

                        I have successfully worked on many different aspects of video games, including design, game management, textures, UI/UX, and sound.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe that the most important part of any game is the user experience, so I focus my efforts on developing the game's look and feel.

                    <p>
                        I also dabble in website design/building and SQL. I'm currently learning C++ in my spare time.

</html> When it comes to games, my main goal is to create an entire experience with characters that people care about and environments so realistic that you feel you could step into them. Games are a form of art, and it takes passion and creativity to make these
immersive worlds. My desire is to build games where the player FEELS like the hero of the story.
</p>
<p>
    Passion can only get you so far, however, so I keep an open mind and try to learn as much as possible. A piece of code rarely works on the first attempt, but I find that the process of searching for and fixing bugs is one of the best teachers, so I'm
    grateful for the opportunity to improve my skills. Though I'm perfectly capable of working alone, I prefer to be a part of a team where I can learn from the strengths of others.
</p>
<p>
    I love coding, and I use C# to create modular assets that can be reused for other games. This includes scripts for health, weaponry, character creation, and UI menus. I have experience using the Monogame framework, but I make most of my games with Unity3D.
    I take great pride in making sure my games have a cohesive theme, so I've been known to spend hours creating my own 2D menus,textures, and sprites in Adobe Photoshop or GIMP.
</p>
<p>
    I received a formal education in Game Programming at the
    <a href="https://www.nait.ca/nait/home">Northern Alberta Institute of Technology</a>.
