            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                You are in control of 4 animals that are stuck in a village of lions. They're peaceful folk, all except for the mayor, of course. He requires a bouquet of flowers, though he never explains why, and he refuses to let anyone leave the village until he gets
                one. Unfortunately, he's so mad at the other villagers that he won't even talk to them, so it's up to you to collect enough flowers for a bouquet. Hopefully, that will make the mayor happy so everyone can finally escape his tyranny!

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>
                This game is what happened when I wanted to create something different from everything else I've made so far. I'm used to side-view platformers that are controlled with the keyboard, so I made this game top-down RTS style, where the characters move by
                clicking the map, other characters, or collectables. I also wanted to try adding things that are common in popular games, like popups, achievements, and NPCs with automatic pathing.
            </p>
            <p>
                As usual, I like to set up a basic level design first so I can test my code as I go. I found some adorable voxel characters on the asset store that I just HAD to use, so I used Probuilder to make some houses that matched their design. Then I finished
                the village layout, positioned all the characters, and organized the scene hierarchy. With everything in place, I opened Visual Studio and started writing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I began with a script that would intercept player clicks and translate that into navmesh destinations. This was fairly easy to do with a raycast and Unity's event system. Since this script holds the current list of selected players, I decided to have
                it update the HUD list as well. I then wrote a game manager script that keeps track of the number of flowers collected, triggering the popup manager to provide feedback. I thought it made more sense to have my code organized by purpose,
                so I put everything related to achievements into its own class that could be called when achievement conditions were met.
            </p>
            <p>
                For NPC pathing, I set up waypoints along the route I wanted the lions to take, then put that into a list so it could cycle through destinations on its own. The lions also stop when selected, and they'll turn to look at the lead player because it felt
                weird otherwise. They resume patrol after a set amount of time if deselected.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, I started testing my game to make sure everything worked as intended. This is a long process, especially since fixing one bug can inadvertently cause others! I had issues using the navmesh in particular, but I managed to fix those problems with
                some research and a bit of finesse.
            </p>

            <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
            <p>
                At first, I thought I bit off more than I could chew with the navmesh aspect. It was extremely confusing, especially since this was my first time using it. But inexperience has never stopped me before, so I persevered and figured it out. The most interesting
                part was "collision handling", which is in quotes because there really aren't any collisions. Instead of physically hitting the other object, I handled collisions by comparing positions and doing something if the selected object is within
                range. The hardest part was making a temporary blockade in front of the village door so you couldn't escape without collecting enough flowers. I eventually realized that all I had to do was allow the blockade to 'carve' out the baked navmesh.
                This raised a new issue where the characters would push the mayor around because of their AI pathfinding, so I put an invisible box around the mayor to prevent it. I'm not sure if that's considered cheating, but hey, it worked!
            </p>
            <p>
                While playtesting the game, I noticed that when a speech panel was open, I could still move the camera around and interact with other things, which caused issues when another lion was selected and its speech panel tried to open. I solved this problem
                by creating another panel that would open behind the speech panel, blocking any errant clicks from affecting the game. I also froze the camera whenever the click blocker was open to make sure the player would focus on the speech panel.
